# MelodySynthesis: Transformer-Based Melody Generation

## 📌 Research Overview

This repository is part of an ongoing research project exploring deep learning approaches for melody synthesis. The study compares different architectures—including **LSTM, Transformer, a Transformer-LSTM hybrid, and a GAN-based Transformer-LSTM hybrid model**—to determine which performs best in generating musically coherent melodies.

This branch (`transformer`) focuses specifically on **Transformer-based melody generation**, investigating how self-attention mechanisms capture musical dependencies in sequences more efficiently than recurrence-based approaches.

## 🎶 Model Architecture

The **Transformer model** uses self-attention layers to understand global patterns in musical sequences. The model's decoder stack comprises multiple layers of attention and feedforward blocks.

### Transformer Decoder Block

The decoder block consists of the following key components, arranged sequentially:

1. **Layer Normalization** – Normalizes the inputs to stabilize and speed up training.
2. **Multi-Head Attention** – Captures dependencies across different positions in the sequence using multiple attention heads.
3. **Dropout** – Applied for regularization to prevent overfitting.
4. **Residual Connection** – Adds the attention output back to the original input to preserve learned features.
5. **Another Layer Normalization** – Normalizes the result again before passing it to the feedforward network.
6. **Position-wise Feedforward Network** – Comprises two Dense layers with ReLU activation in between to introduce non-linearity.
7. **Second Dropout Layer** – Further regularization.
8. **Final Residual Connection** – Adds the feedforward output back to the earlier residual output for stability and gradient flow.

The full model stacks three of these decoder blocks after projecting input through a Dense layer. A final Dense layer with softmax activation generates probability distributions over output notes.

This structure helps the model effectively model long-term dependencies and hierarchical representations in musical sequences.
